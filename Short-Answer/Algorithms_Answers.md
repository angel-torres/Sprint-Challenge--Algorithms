## Exercise I

a)	This snippet will run have an runtime of O(n). This is because the times the while loop runs will increase at the same rate that n increases. Even though the the while loop will run (n*n*n). The value for a will also increase n*n. So even though the while loop will run up to a larger value of a, it will also increase at a higher rate as a increase. 


b)	This snippen will run at O(n^2). This is because the for loop will increase as n increases consistantly. But because there is a nested while loop that also increases with the size of n, we multiply those values and end up with O(n*n). Which reduces to O(n^2)


c) This snippet is O(n) because the larger the number of bunnies then the more times the function will run recusively.
